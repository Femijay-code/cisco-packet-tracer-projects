# Project 1 â€“ Basic VLAN Configuration and Inter-VLAN Routing using Router-on-a-Stick

## Description:
This project simulates a small enterprise network consisting of three departments: Sales, HR, and IT. Each department is assigned a separate VLAN and connected to a central switch. A router-on-a-stick setup is used for inter-VLAN communication. The project includes VLAN creation, interface configuration, trunking, default gateway assignment, and successful ping testing between VLANs.

## Files Included:
