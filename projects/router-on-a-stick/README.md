# Project 2 â€“ Simple Office Network Topology with Basic Device Configuration

## Description:
This project demonstrates the connection of three PCs to a switch and a router, simulating an office network with HR, IT, and Sales departments. The PCs are assigned static IP addresses in different VLANs, and trunking is configured on the switch to support inter-VLAN communication. It covers IP configuration, router sub-interfaces setup, trunk port configuration, and connectivity testing.

## Files Included:
- Project2.pkt (Cisco Packet Tracer file)
- Screenshots (located in the `screenshots/` folder)

## Key Configurations:
- Static IP assignment to all PCs
- VLAN tagging on switch ports
- Trunk port setup between switch and router
- Router sub-interface configuration for inter-VLAN routing
- Ping tests between PCs across VLANs
